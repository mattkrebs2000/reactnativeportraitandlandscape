## Recreate a Webpage with different Portrait & Landscape Views

This repository contains boilerplate conditonal rendering for Portrait and Landscape views as well as an example of how a webpage may be modified when alternating between Landscape and Portrait. It also provides additional "webpage challenges" that can be used to practice on mobile. 

The Portrait View looks like this:

The Landscape View looks like this:

The actual webpage can be found here:

Three websites that can act as challenges for recreation include:

For additional webpages that can be used to recreate on mobile visit: https://www.html.am/templates/simple-website-templates/


The challenge is to recreate these websites on mobile. But also to have 2 different layouts based on whether the phone is in "Portrait" or "Landscape" mode. There should be atleast 3 changes that have been made and that can be seen when you switch the phone from "Portrait" to "Landscape."
